# PhpDevelTest
Test for Php developers that want to join our team

## Introduction
Welcome! This is a small test that will help us to know you better as a developer. 

The code provided is a real example of a working code just before the final refactor step. You probably know that people say that a regular coder stops when the code works, but a good developer stops when working code is clean, readable and maintenable.

So we want you to see take that step from regular coder to good developer to figure out how you think and work.

## Getting started
We provide you a basic Vagrant machine configured so you only have to worry about the coding. Just clone the repository, fire up the Vagrant machine, and make and test your changes (or test and make your changes ;-) ). 

### Executing the tests


## How to send your solution
